This is a website dedicated to Gregorian Chant and specifically, the Dies Irae.

The Dies Irae is important to me because it shaped alot of my interest in musical theory, but also my own personal style of composition.

The website should be mostly responsive on to resolution on all pages, stereotypical hamburger menu go brr.

There are two Javascript frameworks, the Trivia page houses a cute little quiz, and the secret Entity button
at the bottom of the page links to an incomplete, buggy mini Dead by Daylight.

The Quiz also contains cookies that houses and remembers your score for a few days, if it decides to work.
